# A Collection of Vegan Recipes ( Found & Created)

https://jeffreylarrimore.com/vegan-recipes

Trying to see how the Markdown and recipes will work in Github.
Original idea from [@MattKosoy](https://github.com/MattKosoy).
Maybe Eventually hooking up a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
backend to this so we can have a live site and git repo in the background.
