Wild Fennel and Sausage Pasta
===
Serves 6

### Ingredients
- [ ] 1/4 pound wild fennel fronds, leaves and slim (you only want the tender stems)   
- [ ] 3/4 pound sweet or hot sausage
- [ ] 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- [ ] Kosher salt
- [ ] 1 pound Pasta (Penne is ideal)

### Preparation
1. Wash the fronds really good with hot water (They can have little insects in them). 
2. Bring 5 quarts water to a boil. 
3. Add fronds and boil for about 10 minutes, take them out of the water. (Save the water to cook the pasta in)
4. Drain the fronds well and finely mince. (Roughly 1/2 to 2/3 cup minced greens is what you end up with)
5. Break the sausage up into small crumbles or clumps.
6. Heat the olive oil in a 10-inch skillet over moderately high heat. 
7. Add the sausage and cook until it is no longer pink and begins to brown lightly. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon, breaking up the clumps into smaller bits. 
8. Add the fennel greens and stir well to distribute them and coat them with the oil. Season with salt. 
9. Reduce the heat and keep warm.
10. Add 1/4 cup salt to the water in which you cooked the fennel.
11. Return to a boil and add the pasta. Cook until al dente. 
12. Set aside 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta and return it to the skillet with the sausage and fennel greens. 
13. Cook, stirring, over moderate heat for a minute or two to flavor the pasta, moistening it with some of the reserved pasta water. 
14. Serve immediately.
