## Ingredients

* 3 cups old rice (can not be fresh cooked should be like day old out of fridge is best)
* homemade seitan or just chicken style seitan
* 1/2 block firm tofu
* Sometimes peas if you want to get sweet!
* 1/2-3/4 white or yellow onion
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 full scallion
* 2 baby bok choy
* turmeric
* cayenne
* light soy sauce or Braggs Liquid Amino Acids
* white & black pepper
* salt
* coconut oil or veggie oil


## Cooking

1. Chop veggies the way you prefer them, I usually make sure to cut the bok choy whites thin and half the leaves
2. make sure your seitan is cut up into single bite chunks
3. Mash tofu up in bowl and mix turmeric, cayenne, & a little soy sauce, until it looks like scrambled eggs!
4. Warm your wok on high heat, and when at a good temperature turn down to between high & medium
5. Add oil a good amount to cover the area you are going to be cooking in (if not wok just make sure you cover the bottom)
6. Throw in seitan to fry it up till brown
7. Then throw in your onions, fake egg (tofu), garlic, scallions, and baby bok choy and cook it about 3/4 way
8. Now throw in your rice! If your oil has cooked out add a tablespoon or a little more.
9. Make sure all the rice chunks are gone, while mixing up a lot while adding the soy sauce to get that desired brown! Not to much or you will ruin it. (always taste!)
10. Cook rice till fully light brown and fired while adding your spices to your desire.
11. Serve and enjoy!
