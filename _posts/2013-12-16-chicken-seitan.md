Serving Size: **4 Cutlets**

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 Cup Vital Wheat Gluten
- 2 Tbs Nutritional Yeast
- 1 tsp Old Bay Seasoning
- 3/4 Cup Cold Water
- 1 Tbs Tamari or Soy Sauce (low sodium)
- 3 Tbs Soymilk
- 1 Tbs Olive Oil
- Braising Broth
    - 2 Cups Water
    - 1 Vegetable Bullion Cube

## Preparation

1. Mix the dry ingredients together. Combine the wet ingredients and stir well. Add wet to dry and knead until a dough is formed. Add more liquid if needed. The gluten will develop very quickly. Knead a few times on your counter, forming a ball. Cut the ball in quarters, forming four triangular wedges. Squish/Pound/Pull the wedges into 1/2″ thick cutlets. Take your time shaping, letting them rest if needed.

2. Once they’re the right thickness, put a large, high-walled skillet on medium heat, adding the water and bullion cube to make a braising bath. Once it starts simmering, add cutlets and turn down the heat and cover. It’s important that you DO NOT boil the cutlets. Check several times to make sure the broth is just barely simmering. Boiling isn’t a disaster, but it will change the texture of the cutlets, making them spongier and rubbery.

3. Simmer, covered for 20-30 minutes, flipping halfway through. You can now refrigerate the cutlets in their broth for later, or fry immediately. I think cutlets that have been refrigerated over night before frying have a better texture, but you can use them right away.
