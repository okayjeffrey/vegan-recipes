Serving Size: **1 quesadilla**

## Ingredients

- 1 spring/summer roll rice paper (circle or square works)
- 1 veggie fish shredded
- 1 veggy ham shredded
- a couple leaves of basil
- 1-2 cilantro sprigs
- 1 tablespoon of scallions chopped
- half spoon of vegan butter
- Fake egg beater
  - 1/4 can of coconut milk
  - tablespoon of Bánh xèo powder or rice flour
  - 2 teaspoon of turmeric
  - sprinkle of nutritional yeast flakes
- ribbed griddle or on charcoal grill low flame

## Preparation
1. The key is cooking the rice paper on something that allows heat and air to get to bottom.
2. Take the spoon of vegan butter and all the ingredients and place them on the rice paper like you would a quesadilla, sans heat.
3. Place the rice paper stacked with ingredients over a dry hot surface
4. Pour the mixed "fake egg beater" ingredients over the dry ingredients, mix with spoon to get everything covered, while mixing make sure you are wetting every part of the rice paper with the fake egg. This helps it become soft.
5. Now the rice paper is wet like it would be to make a spring roll but the heat is crisping it, when the rice paper starts to bubble that's when you can fold it over like a quesadilla and serve. Letting it sit helps the rice paper become more cracker like.
6. It is eaten whole almost like a crepe, do not try and cut it will fall apart.
