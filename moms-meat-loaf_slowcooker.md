## Preparation

1. For the best flavor, heat the 2 tsp. or oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes
2. Add the garlic and thyme and cook 1 minute longer. Alternatively, combine these ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl, cover, and microwave for 3 minutes. Set aside
3. In a food processor, combine the beans, tofu, 1/2 cup of the ketchup, Worcestershire, mustard, and the reserve onion mixture and process to mix well
4. In a large bowl, combine the walnuts, oats, bread crumbs, vital wheat gluten, tapioca starch, and parsley. Season with 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper
5. Add the bean mixture and stir well to mix thoroughly
6. Turn out the mixture onto a wok surface and shape into a round or oval to fin inside your slow cooker, pressing to make sure the loaf holds together
7. Generously oil the insert of the slow cooker or spray it with nonstick cooking spray
8. Arrange the carrot slices evenly in the bottom of the cooker. Season with a little salt and pepper, then arrange the potato slices on top of the carrots. Drizzle with a little olive oil
9. Set the reserved loaf on top of the potatoes and surround with the shallots
10. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup ketchup with the mustard, brown sugar, and vinegar and mix well. Spread the mixture on top of the loaf. Cover and cook on Low for 4 hours
11. Remove the lid, turn of the cooker, and allow the loaf to rest for 10 minutes. Transfer the loaf carefully with a large spatula to a large serving platter and surround it with the carrots, potatoes, and shallots. Slice the loaf carefully with a serrated knife
